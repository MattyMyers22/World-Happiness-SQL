/* OBJECTIVE:
To explore and clean the data from the World Happiness studies for 2015 - 2019 with the purpose of importing into Tableau.
The data collected for one year is often in a different format for various years from 2015 to 2019. For example, region 
not being included for some years as well as columns having different names.
